## 📊 Guess the correlation ##
D. Correlation cannot be 0.

## 📊 Relationships between variables ##
Instruction 1/4:

    # Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp and show
    sns.scatterplot(x = 'life_exp', y = 'happiness_score', data = world_happiness)

    # Show plot
    plt.show()

Instruction 2/4:

    # Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
    sns.lmplot(x = 'life_exp', y = 'happiness_score', data = world_happiness, ci = None)

    # Show plot
    plt.show()

Instruction 3/4:
C. 0.8

Instruction 4/4:

    # Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
    sns.lmplot(x='life_exp', y='happiness_score', data=world_happiness, ci=None)

    # Show plot
    plt.show()

    # Correlation between life_exp and happiness_score
    cor = world_happiness['life_exp'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])

    print(cor)

## 📊 What can't correlation measure? ##
Instruction 1/3:

    # Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
    sns.scatterplot(x = 'gdp_per_cap', y = 'life_exp', data = world_happiness)

    # Show plot
    plt.show()

Instruction 2/3:

    # Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
    sns.scatterplot(x='gdp_per_cap', y='life_exp', data=world_happiness)

    # Show plot
    plt.show()
    
    # Correlation between gdp_per_cap and life_exp
    cor = world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['life_exp'])

    print(cor)

Instruction 3/3:
B. Correlation only measures linear relationships.

## 📊 Transforming variables ##
Instruction 1/2:

    # Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. gdp_per_cap
    sns.scatterplot(x = 'gdp_per_cap', y = 'happiness_score', data = world_happiness)
    plt.show()

    # Calculate correlation
    cor = world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
    print(cor)

Instruction 2/2:

    # Create log_gdp_per_cap column
    world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'] = np.log(world_happiness['gdp_per_cap'])

    # Scatterplot of log_gdp_per_cap and happiness_score
    sns.scatterplot(x = 'log_gdp_per_cap', y = 'happiness_score', data = world_happiness)
    plt.show()

    # Calculate correlation
    cor = world_happiness['log_gdp_per_cap'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])
    print(cor)

## 📊 Does sugar improve happiness? ##
Instruction 1/2:

    # Scatterplot of grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
    sns.scatterplot(x= 'grams_sugar_per_day', y = 'happiness_score', data = world_happiness)

    plt.show()

    # Correlation between grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
    cor = world_happiness['grams_sugar_per_day'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])

    print(cor)

Instruction 2/2:
C. Increased sugar consumption is associated with a higher happiness score.

## 📊 Confounders ##
C. Air pollution

## 📊 Study types ##
Controlled experiment:
1. Subjucts are randomly assigned to a diet and weight loss is compared.
2. Asthma symptoms are compared between children randomly assigned to receive professional home pest management services or pest management education.
3. purchasing rates are compared between users of an e-commerce site who are randomly directed to a new version of the home page or an old version.

Observational study:
1. A week ago, the home page of an e-commerce site was updated. purchasing rates are compared between users who saw the old and new home page versions.
2. Prevalence of heart disease is compared between veterans with PTSD and veterans without PTSD.
