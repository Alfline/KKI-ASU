## 📊 Descriptive and inferential statistics ##
Descriptive:
1. Given data on every coustomer service request made, whats the average time it took to respont?
2. Given data on all 100,000 people who viewed an ad, what percent clicked on it?

Inferential:
1. Given data on 20 fish caught in a lake, what's the average weight of all fish in the lake?
2. After interviewing 100 customers, what percent pf all your customers are satisfied with your product?

## 📊 Finding outliers using IQR ##
Instruction 1/4:

    # Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of emissions_by_country
    q1 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.25)

    iqr = q3 - q1

    # Calculate the lower and upper cutoffs for outliers
    lower = q1 - (1.5 * iqr)
    upper = q3 + (1.5 * iqr)
