## 📊 Distribution of Amir's sales ##
Instruction 1/2:

    # Histogram of amount with 10 bins and show plo
    amir_deals['amount'].hist(bins = 10)

## 📊 Probabilities from the normal distribution ##
Instruction 1/4:

## 📊 Identifying lambda ##
Lambda = Highest frequency of Y Axis from the respected X Axis, for example Lambda = 1 the distribution will look Right-Skewed since the distribution clumped up around X value of 1.

lambda = 1

## 📊 Distribution dragging and dropping ##
Poisson:
1. Number of products sold each week
2. Number of customers that enter a store each hour

Exponential:
1. Amount of time unitil someone pays off their loan
2. Amount of time until the next customer makes a purchase

Binomial:
1. Number of people from a group of 30 that pass their driving test
