(1.) Your first Python code:
        Just Copy to the IPython Shell: print(5 / 8)

(2.) Python as a calculator
    Just overwrite the code below to the scipt.py then "Run Code", "Submit Answer"
# Addition and division
print(4 + 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Subtraction
print(5 / 5)

# Multiplication
print(3 * 5)

(3.) Variables and Types
    Just skip the video

(4.) Variable Assignment
    Just overwrite the code below to the scipt.py then "Run Code", "Submit Answer"
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

(5.) Calculations with variables
    Just overwrite the code below to the scipt.py then "Run Code", "Submit Answer"
# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Print new_savings
print(new_savings)

(6.) Other variable types
    Just overwrite the code below to the scipt.py then "Run Code", "Submit Answer"
# Create a variable half
half = 0.5

# Create a variable intro
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Create a variable is_good
is_good = True

(7.) Operations with other types
    Just overwrite the code below to the scipt.py then "Run Code", "Submit Answer"
        Part 1: Numerical Operations
savings = 100
new_savings = 40

# Calculate total_savings using savings and new_savings
total_savings = savings + new_savings
print(total_savings)  # Output: 140 [1]

# Print the type of total_savings
print(type(total_savings))  # Output: <class 'int'> [2]

     Part 2: String Operations
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate doubleintro by concatenating intro with itself
doubleintro = intro + intro
print(doubleintro)  # Output: Hello! How are you?Hello! How are you? [3][4]
