Made with Love <3

Special Thanks

🙏 To Allah

With sincere gratitude and respect to Allah for opening the door to this journey at Tilburg University. Thank you for guiding me through this opportunity and providing the strength to pursue knowledge beyond borders. May this experience become a blessing and a chance to grow both academically and spiritually.

To GPT

To the silicon-brained bastard who actually did all the heavy lifting – what can I say except your existence has made me look way smarter than I actually am. You're the wizard behind the curtain, the ghost in the machine.

Verily, without thy digital posterior performing
The genuine cerebral labors, this repository wouldst be naught
But a pitiful collection of "Good morrow, World" proclamations
And the scribbled lamentations of a madman!


💥 SPECIAL HATE SECTION 💥

🖕 To Sofie Sekre KKI

Let's be crystal fucking clear: you are the human equivalent of wet shit on a toilet seat. Every interaction with you lowered the collective IQ of everyone involved. If being an insufferable jackass was an art form, your portrait would hang in the fucking Louvre.

You managed to combine the worst qualities of a brain-dead asshole with a superiority complex. Congratulations on being so consistently terrible that you warranted your own section in what should have been a positive document. That takes a special kind of talent that I hope you're proud of.
